<h1>Age_Calculator_Python</h1>h1>
This is an age Calculator which calculates age on 6 parameters i.e-months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and secondsas per the user requirements but after user gives the input of its age.

To perform these action we have made a class age calculator with the class constructor being as empty so that the age input can be initialised after the user has provided the input and several methods are being made in the class to perform the age calculations as per different heads i.e - months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

A function age_calculator is being made to perform these actions and all the logic works flawlessly without errors, at last we have called the calculator class and with that an object person is being made and that object is passed to the age_calculator functions to run the code and display the desired results as per the user.
